# Cipher
This is a fun little cipher encoder/decoder I made

In order to use, make sure to run from terminal (or an emulation of) in order for the initial selections to work

Available Ciphers:
- Atbash
- Caesar
- Columnar
- Letter-Number
- Morse
- Pig Latin
- Playfair
- Rail-Fence

This project was made with the help of GitHub Copilot and Google Gemini (mainly for the matrix parts...)
