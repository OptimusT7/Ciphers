# Cipher
This is a fun little cipher encoder/decoder I made

In order to use, make sure to run from terminal (or an emulation of) in order for the initial selections to work

Avaliable Ciphers:
- Atbash
- Caesar
- Columnar
- Rail-Fence
- Playfair

This project was made with the help of Github Copilot (mainly for the matrix parts...)
